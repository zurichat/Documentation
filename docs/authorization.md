## Errors

When an error occurs, you will receive an error object. Most of these error objects contain an error code and an error description so that your applications can more efficiently identify the problem.

If you get a 4xx response code, then you can assume that there is a bad request from your end. In this case,
check the [Standard Error Responses](#standard-error-responses) for more context.

5xx errors suggest a problem on server's end.

## Standard Error Responses

The Authentication API may return the following HTTP Status Codes:
