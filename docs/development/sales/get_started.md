# **GETTING STARTED WITH THE SALES PLUGIN**

# Quickstart
## Forking and Cloning the Repo
​
Fork the repo from (https://github.com/zurichat/zc_plugin_company_sales_prospect) then copy the HTTPS link from your fork which will look like this (https://github.com/{your-github-username}/zc_plugin_company_sales_prospect.git).
Then proceed to your terminal or CMD and clone the repo in a new folder using the git command  ` git clone  ` as a prefix to the copied link
​
# Local development
​
## Running the app locally
​
## React Server
Still in a terminal go to the `frontend/mainApp` directory and then run the following:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```
The server will run on http://localhost:8080/
To actually build run `yarn build`
​
## Django server
​
Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the cloned repo. <br/>
Then store your SECRET_KEY and DEBUG variables in the file
​
```
SECRET_KEY="<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>" can be any string
DEBUG=1
```
Then run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt (should take a while)
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
The server will run on http://localhost:8200/
​
​
## Fullstack Server
There are 2 root directories, backend and frontend
In the `/frontend/` root directory, the rootApp and mainApp. <br/>
Firstly in `/frontend/rootApp/`<br/>
​
1. Go to `/frontend/rootApp/src/index.ejs`
2. Go to line 33 and change `isLocal` to `!isLocal` PLEASE SWITCH IT BACK BEFORE PUSHING, IT SHOULD BE `isLocal`.
3. Then go back to `/frontend/rootApp/` and run `yarn relocate`
4. Then go to `/frontend/mainApp/` and run `yarn relocate`
5. Then you move to the `/backend/` root directory, run: <br/>
`python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` <br/>
6. Then run `python manage.py runserver`.

# Laws to follow while contributing (making a PR)
​
 1. Please while in `/frontend/rootApp/src/index.ejs`, it should be `isLocal` not `!isLocal`.
​
 2. Every new installation on the backend should be added to the requirements.txt file using the command pip freeze > requirements.txt
​
 3. Users must have pulled from upstream to avoid conflicts
​
 4. All new views should be documented with doc strings and comments where appropriate 
​
 5. Always check the source control on the sidebar of your VS-code and other text editors,also the files changed section of your commit/PR before requesting for merge files changed above 6 may not be merged without proper testing 
​
# Troubleshooting possible errors that may occur
​
 1. SECRET_KEY not set error. This can be solved adding the SECRET_KEY and making sure that the .env file is in the project root like so
    ```
    -backend
    -frontend
    -README.md
    -.env
​
    ```
 2. Error while installing requirements.txt. this means a particular package was not compatible with your system and  this can be solved by rooting out the bad install and commenting it out from the requirements.txt
