# Read, write, query data from zc_core

## What is zc_core

## Read data from zc_core

### Data Read

The current implementation is exposed at the [POST] /data/read endpoint. The request payload expected is of the following format.

```json
{
  "plugin_id": "",
  "collection_name": "",
  "organization_id": "",
  "object_id": "",
  "object_ids": [], // useful if you want to get results for a list of ids.
  "filter": {}, // can be used in place of id to match documents by other fields.
  "options": {}, //[OPTIONAL] contains query results modifiers.
  "raw_query": {} // [OPTIONAL] if you are not satisfied with the filter object and are a mongodb wiz use this to send an object in regular mongoDB query language format.
}
```

the filter object should contain the field(s) you want to match and their values. The options is an object with the following valid properties:

- limit (integer): To set a limit on the results to be returned.
- skip (integer): to set an offset value for the results.
- sort (Object): field to sort by in descending (-1) or ascending order (1) e.g "sort": {"name": 1}
- projection (Object): field to include (1) or exclude (0) in the results e.g "projection": {"field": 1}

The old data read endpoint is exposed at the [GET] /data/read/{plugin_id}/{collection_name}/{organization_id} endpoint.

Once the api receives this request, it checks the internal record to validate that the plugin with this {plugin_id} is the one that created the {collection_name} for the org with this {organization_id}.

Once this is established to be true, then access is granted and the api returns the data requested as an array. Extra simple mongodb query parameters can be passed as a url query param e.g ?title=this and the api uses it to query the database.

To find an item by id, pass in the query parameter id or \_id with the appropriate value . A single document/object is returned instead of a list if the item is found. NOTE: This endpoint will be deprecated, switch to the POST endpoint.

## Write data for zc_core

### Data Write (Create and Update)

Plugins are allowed to write data to the database by calling the /data/write endpoint with any of the POST, PUT, http methods. Based on this methods a CREATE, UPDATE action will be performed on the database. The plugin would have to provide the following json data body

```json
{
  "plugin_id": "xxx",
  "organization_id": "xxx",
  "collection_name": "mycollection",
  "bulk_write": false,
  "object_id": "xxxx",
  "filter": {},
  "payload": {},
  "raw_query": {}
}
```

The plugin_id, organization_id, collection_name fields are important, so it can enable the core api locate the right collection to write data, as the data collections created by plugins are stored seperately for different organizations.
An internal record is also kept by the core api that validates that this three values are valid, i.e the plugin that is requesting data from this collection for this organization is the one that created it.

This is to prevent other plugins from accessing collections they didn't create. The bulk_write field is a boolean indicating if multiple records are to be inserted, updated or deleted, if it is set to true, then payload should be an array, if it is false, payload should be a simple plain object.

The object_id and filter fields are used for updating and deleting data. If bulk_write is to be performed, the filter field should be set and should contain the query to be matched for an update, else if performing a single document operation, the object_id field should be set instead with the id of the object.

The payload contains the actual data the plugin wants to store. The schema is decided by the plugin app. It could be an array of objects or a single object based on if its a bulk_write operation or not.

The raw_query field allows the user to perform raw mongodb queries when updating like using aggregation operations, $addToSet etc etc and should only be used if you know what you are doing.

Once this data is passed, the api performs the operation and sends a response containing the success status and how many documents were successfully written.

## Delete Data

To delete data, a POST request is made to /data/delete

```json
{
 "plugin_id": "xxx",
 "organization_id": "xxx",
 "collection_name": "mycollection",
 "bulk_delete": false,
 "object_id": "xxxx",
 "filter": {},
```

The bulk_delete and filter properties are used to delete multiple records. filter will contain the query to be matched and bulk_delete must be set to true to use this filter property.

## List Data Collections

Plugins can now request to see a list of collections they have created.

The a GET request to /data/collections/<plugin_id> will return a record of collections created by the plugin. while a request to /data/collections/<plugin_id>/<org_id> will return a record of collections a plugin has created for a particular organization
